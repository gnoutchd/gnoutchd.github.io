<h1>How to say "Daniel Gnoutcheff"</h1>

<p>My last name is pronounced "guh-nu-cheth", i.e. with a hard "g" (such that
it alliterates with 
"<a href="https://www.gnu.org/pronunciation/pronunciation.html">GNU</a>",
appropriately enough :).  In
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IPA_for_English">IPA</a>, it
probably would be written as /ɡənuːtʃɛf/.  Here's audio of me saying my
name:</p>

<blockquote><p><audio controls="">
  <source src="pronunciation.ogg" type="audio/ogg" />
  <source src="pronunciation.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
  in <a href="pronunciation.ogg">Ogg Vorbis</a> or
  <a href="pronunciation.mp3">MP3</a>.
</audio></p></blockquote>

<p>No worries if you can't remember how to pronounce it.  Mispronunciations are
a valued source of amusement. :)</p>

<p>I have no middle names, partially because with a name like "Gnoutcheff",
there's little need for them.  My unusual last name provides uniqueness while
preserving brevity, which makes it great for search engines :).</p>

<p>As for my first name: I pronounce it the usual way, and I typically write it
as "Daniel", although I also respond to "Dan" or "Danny".  It does occasionally
lead to confusion when I'm in the company of other Daniels -- which seems to be
rather common.</p>
