<p>Modern laptop hard drives usually have a power management feature known as head parking. When used properly, head parking can save power and make a hard drive less susceptible to damage. However, many hard drive firmwares contain a bug that can cause excessive and inefficient use of head parking, leading to rapid wear and tear. Nearly all distributions of the Linux operating system trigger this bug, resulting in numerous failed hard drives and a wave of negative publicity. This project was an attempt to help fix this problem.</p>
